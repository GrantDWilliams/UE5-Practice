# Practice Projects
<sup>The first three projects were made following a tutorial specifically for them on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/aUzAXQZE750?si=GOVvDwrD7jGBbvkg).</sup>

## 1. Platformer
Platformer was simply about collision and death/victory. It's a short obstacle course with randomly placed coins and an end goal to trigger a win state.
Simple animation was used to make moving obstacles as well hitboxes for death states.

## 2. Clicker2d
Clicker2d was my attempt at creating a 2d clicker game, akin to cookie clicker (It even has a cookie). It makes liberal use of interface elements and mathematical calculations.
It's limited in scope as a proof of concept, but could be easily expanded.

## 3. Collectathon
Collectathon takes the basic starter area and adds collectables and an ending hallway that opens once they're all collected.
This was to test triggers and interactions between different objects and the environment.
